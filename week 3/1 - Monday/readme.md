## Introduction to Functional Diversity and Biodiversity and Ecosystem Functioning (BEF)

## To Do BEFORE class at 12pm on Monday (establish experiment Friday afternoon, make observations Monday morning)

**Project. Bird diversity, ‘functional’ diversity, and their role in ecosystems**

Question: How does bird diversity and functional diversity vary between sites?  How does this influence their role in the functioning of ecosystems?

***Diversity and Functional Diversity:***

Alternative Hypothesis 1: Both taxonomic and functional diversity increase at the same rate

Alternative Hypothesis 2: Taxonomic diversity increases more than functional diversity

***Role in Ecosystem Functioning***

Alternative Hypothesis 1: Diversity and/or functional diversity will not influence the functioning of ecosystems

Alternative Hypothesis 2: Diversity and/or functional diversity will influence the functioning of ecosystems

**Experimental steps:**
1. Use the 'seed balls' provided to you by the instructor.  Each of you has 6 seed balls with 'fruits' and 6 seed balls with 'insects'.  

2. On Friday afternoon (January 20) (or latest Saturday morning), choose two experimental sites that you strongly suspect have different levels of diversity of seed eating birds.  For example, urban parks will mostly have sparrows and starlings, and a few other species (e.g., blue tits). Larger parks with forests and open lands will have those species, but also likely many others (great tits, wagtails, warblers, creepers, wrens, woodpeckers, etc). Choose 'feeding' locations within each site that are similar, such as in a tall shrub or branch of a tree and tie one seed ball to it (do not put them on the ground, where small mammals can also get to them). At each site (urban vs forest), choose three similar sites (shrub/tree) nearby each other (e.g., within 10-20 m) and deploy 3 seed balls at each site so that you can observe birds visiting all seed balls at the same time. I recommend finding sites near where you see birds foraging (usually on edges), and even near other feeding areas would be good so that birds are familiar with the feeding area. In all, you will have 3 seed balls near each other in one site (low diversity) and another 3 seed balls near each other in the other site (high diversity).

3. Check on your seed balls at least once over the weekend. Make sure they are still in place, and check to see if birds have found them. If they seem that no birds have found them, you can consider moving them to a 'better' location nearby. Make observations of which species (and how many) seem to be visiting to prepare yourself for data collection on Monday (you don't need to collect data over the weekend, just make preliminary observations to prepare your worksheet). Bird identification is not essential, as long as you can tell that species are different (or even get a picture). However, there are many good apps and sources for identifiying birds (e.g., iNaturalist and seek). Even by sound (merlin bird ID is a great app!).

4. *Measuring Functional Diversity*. Take note of differences in the ‘functional traits’ of species you observe. This will be up to you, but for example, some species have shorter legs, some have longer legs. Some have long/skinny beaks, others have short/fat beaks. Some forage in groups while others forage alone. Try to put species/traits into categories. Some traits that you use to tell species apart (e.g., color, feather crests) will not likely have any functional role, so avoid using those traits.

5. *measuring species visitation*. On Monday morning, 

7. *Measuring ecosystem functioning*. Exxxx

   a. prime the area by throwing a small amount of bread into the water, to get the birds to notice the food and start feeding.
  
   b. throw the food out all at once so that there is a large volume of food in the water.
  
   c. using a stop watch, time how long it takes for all of the food to be consumed by the birds.
  
   d. if it is not consumed within 10 minutes, estimate the proportion of food that was left unconsumed. Also try to note how many items of food sink and are not consumed (or are consumed by fish instead).
